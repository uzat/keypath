Assumptions & Design Decisions

	Have assumed a plan of Premium for the app services to accommodate the required scaling suring busy times - cost or budget was not in scope on the brief
	Managed identity (3rd party API, DB) is not in scope as not mentioned on the brief
	Location is not in scope (my default would be Australia SE)
	Message size < 64k so Event Grid and not Service Bus
	Source DB and API not under KeyPath administration


Next Steps or MVP+1

	Abstract logging to service
	Move logging to AppInsights/Log Analytics
	Use Azure SQL Trigger + modify table to allow change tracking
